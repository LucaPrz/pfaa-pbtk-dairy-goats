"""
Minimal analysis package.

The fitting code optionally imports ``Analysis.identifiability`` to compute
diagnostics.  Those diagnostics are not essential for running the fitting
pipeline, so in this clean repository we provide a very small stub
implementation that keeps the imports working without re‑implementing all
analysis scripts from the original project.
